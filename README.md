### üìö What I Learned / Key Concepts

This module explains the ‚Äúbackbone‚Äù of digital communications, a non-negotiable skill in cybersecurity.

#### 1. **Reference Models: OSI vs TCP/IP**
   - **OSI Model (7 layers):** A theoretical model that divides communication into 7 layers (Physical, Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application). It is useful for learning and diagnosing problems.
   - **TCP/IP Model (4 layers):** The practical and real model on which the Internet is based (Link, Internet, Transport, Application).
   - We learned to **compare and contrast** both models, seeing how their layers relate to each other.

#### 2. **IP Addressing and Subnets**
   - **IP Addresses:** The unique identifiers of devices on a network (e.g., `192.168.1.1` for IPv4).
   - **Subnets:** How large networks are divided into smaller parts for better organization and security.

#### 3. **Transport Protocols: TCP vs UDP**
   - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**
     - **Connection-oriented.** Establishes a channel before sending data.
     - **Reliable.** Ensures that packets arrive in order and without errors.
     - **Slower.** Used for web (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP), file transfer (FTP).
   - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**
     - **Connectionless.** Sends data without establishing a channel first.
     - **Unreliable.** Does not guarantee delivery or order.
- **Faster.** Used for video/audio streaming, VoIP, DNS.

#### 4. **Encapsulation**
   - The process of **adding information from each layer (headers)** to application data as it travels ‚Äúdown‚Äù the protocol stack to be transmitted over the network.
   - At the destination, the process is reversed (‚Äúup‚Äù), removing each header until the original data is reached.

#### 5. **Hands-on Demonstration with Telnet**
   - The **`telnet`** command was used to ‚Äútalk‚Äù directly to services (such as web servers) over TCP on a specific port.
   - This demonstrated in a tangible way how a connection is established at the application/transport level.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Why is this important?**
- **Fundamentals of Cybersecurity:** To defend, audit, or attack a network, **you must understand how it works.**
- **Traffic Analysis:** Tools such as Wireshark require this knowledge to analyze packets and detect malicious activity.

## Module Completed: [Networking Essentials]

**Completion Date:** [2025/09/25]
**Module Objective:** Understand the functioning and importance of fundamental protocols that enable modern networks to operate, from automatic device configuration to global routing on the Internet.

### üìö What I Learned / Protocols Explored

This module delves into the protocols that enable automatic and efficient network communication.

#### 1. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
   - **What does it do?** It automatically assigns IP addresses and other network parameters (such as the gateway and DNS server) to devices when they connect to a network.
   - **Analogy:** It is the ‚Äúautomatic rental‚Äù of IP addresses on a network.
   - **Importance in Cybersecurity:** A malicious DHCP server can trick devices into connecting to it, redirecting their traffic (‚ÄúDHCP Spoofing‚Äù attack).

#### 2. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**
   - **What does it do?** It finds the MAC (physical) address of a device when only its IP (logical) address is known within a local network.
   - **Fernando's diagram:** ‚ÄúWho has this IP? -> Tell me your MAC.‚Äù
   - **Importance in Cybersecurity:** Vulnerable to ‚ÄúARP Spoofing‚Äù or ‚ÄúARP Poisoning,‚Äù where an attacker can trick the network into sending traffic intended for someone else.

#### 3. **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**
   - **What does it do?** It is used to send control and error messages between network devices.
   - **Key Tools:**
     - **`Ping`:** Checks if a host is active and reachable on the network. (Uses ICMP Echo Request and Reply).
     - **`Traceroute`/`Tracert`:** Discovers the route that packets take to reach a destination, showing all intermediate routers.
   - **Importance in Cybersecurity:** Essential for network diagnostics. Attackers use it to ‚Äúmap‚Äù a network (discover active hosts). ICMP traffic is often blocked by firewalls to prevent this.

#### 4. **Routing Protocols**
   - **What do they do?** They are the ‚Äúnavigation systems‚Äù of routers. They allow them to share information with each other to find the best route to send packets across different networks.
   - **Main Protocols:**
     - **OSPF & EIGRP:** Used within large networks within the same organization (e.g., a company).
     - **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):** The protocol that **connects the Internet**. It manages routing *between* large service providers (ISPs). It is the most critical protocol globally.
- **RIP:** An older and simpler protocol.
- **Importance in Cybersecurity:** An attack on BGP can redirect Internet traffic on a massive scale. Understanding routing is key to defending an organization's perimeter network.

#### 5. **NAT (Network Address Translation)**
   - **What does it do?** It translates private IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.10`) from a local network to a single public IP address to access the Internet. It allows many devices to share a single public IP.
   - **Analogy:** It is the ‚Äúreceptionist‚Äù of an office. All employees (private IPs) use the same office address (public IP) to send emails outside the office.
   - **Importance in Cybersecurity:** It hides the internal structure of a network from the Internet, acting as a first layer of defense (concealment). It is essential in any home router.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Practical Conclusion**
These protocols are the ‚Äúinvisible magic‚Äù that makes networks work. A system administrator or cybersecurity professional must understand them in order to:
-   **Diagnose problems** with connectivity effectively.
-   **Understand and exploit** common vulnerabilities such as ARP Spoofing.
-   **Secure the configuration** of routers and firewalls.

- **Specifying Address:** Use `src` (source) and `dst` (destination) to refine filters, such as `src host 192.168.1.1`.

#### 2. **Advanced Filtering: Logical and Bit-Level Operators**
- **Combine Conditions:** Use logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not` to create complex filters. Example: `tcpdump ‚Äòudp or icmp‚Äô`.
- **Filtering by TCP Flags:** Bit-level analysis to identify packets with specific flags. For example, `tcpdump ‚Äòtcp[tcpflags] == tcp-rst‚Äô` captures packets with only the RST flag set. This approach is powerful for detecting scans or connectivity issues.

#### 3. **Output and Display Options (Your ‚ÄúGlasses‚Äù)**
- **`-q` (Quick Output):** Displays a simplified, clean view of traffic.
- **`-e` (Link Header):** Includes MAC addresses in the output, crucial for analyzing traffic on the local network (e.g., ARP packets).
- **`-A` (ASCII Output):** Shows the packet contents in plain text, ideal for reading unencrypted data such as HTTP requests.
- **`-X` / `-xx` (Hexadecimal and ASCII Output):** Reveals the complete contents of the packet in hexadecimal along with its ASCII representation. It is the ultimate tool for analyzing any type of traffic, especially when it is encrypted.

#### 4. **Reading and Analyzing PCAP Files**
- **`-r` (Read from File):** The option `tcpdump -r capture.pcap` allows you to analyze saved traffic captures, facilitating post-incident forensic analysis.
- **Integration with other tools:** Use pipes (`|`) with tools such as `wc -l` to count packets that match a filter.

### üõ†Ô∏è Practical Conclusion

Mastering Tcpdump involves understanding that it is not about memorizing commands, but rather **understanding the logic of filters and knowing how to construct specific queries**. The ability to accurately capture and filter network traffic from the terminal is a fundamental skill for troubleshooting, network monitoring, and security analysis tasks.

> **Key Skill Acquired:** Being able to perform an initial and specific analysis of network traffic in environments where a graphical interface such as Wireshark is not available, especially in remote server administration via SSH.

Module Completed: Nmap: The Basics
Completion Date: [2025/09/26]
Module Objective: Master the fundamental capabilities of Nmap for network discovery, port scanning, service detection, and result management in ethical hacking and network diagnostics.

üìö What I Learned / Skills Acquired
This module transformed Nmap from a simple port scanner into a comprehensive network exploration tool. The focus was on practical application for security assessments and network analysis.

1. Network Discovery & Host Enumeration
List Scan (-sL): Passive reconnaissance to enumerate targets without sending packets to the network.

Ping Scan (-sn): Efficient host discovery using ICMP and ARP requests to identify active devices on a network.

Forced Scan (-Pn): Treat all hosts as online, bypassing host discovery for networks that block ping requests.

2. Port Scanning Techniques (The Core of Nmap)
TCP Connect Scan (-sT): Completes full TCP three-way handshake. Reliable but easily detectable.

TCP SYN Scan (-sS): Default when run with sudo. Sends SYN packet only (half-open scan). Faster and stealthier.

UDP Scan (-sU): Discovers open UDP ports. Slower due to UDP's connectionless nature.

Port Specification: Mastered using -p- for all ports, -F for top 100 ports, and custom ranges like -p 22,80,443.

3. Service & OS Detection
Version Detection (-sV): Probes open ports to determine service/application versions.

OS Fingerprinting (-O): Detects operating system based on network stack characteristics.

Aggressive Scan (-A): Combines OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

4. Timing & Performance Optimization
Timing Templates (-T0 to -T5): From paranoid (T0) to insane (T5). Learned to balance speed vs. stealth.

Parallelism Control: --min-parallelism and --max-parallelism for managing concurrent probes.

Rate Management: --min-rate and --max-rate for precise packet control per second.

Host Timeouts: --host-timeout for handling slow or unresponsive targets.

5. Output Formats & Verbosity
Verbosity Levels (-v, -vv, -vvv): Real-time progress monitoring during long scans.

Debug Levels (-d, -dd, -d9): Detailed technical output for troubleshooting.

Output Formats: Mastered -oN (normal), -oX (XML), -oG (grepable), and -oA (all formats).

üõ†Ô∏è Practical Conclusion
The key insight from this module is that effective Nmap usage requires strategic thinking about the scanning context. The same target requires different approaches for a stealthy penetration test versus a quick network inventory.

Critical Realization: Running Nmap with sudo privileges unlocks its full potential, particularly the stealthy SYN scan (-sS) which becomes the default. Without privileges, Nmap falls back to the slower, more detectable TCP Connect scan (-sT).

The ability to chain options like sudo nmap -sS -sV -O -T4 -A -p- -oA full_scan target represents a professional-grade approach to comprehensive network assessment.

Key Skill Acquired: Designing tailored scanning methodologies based on specific objectives‚Äîwhether for rapid reconnaissance, stealthy penetration testing, or detailed service enumeration.
