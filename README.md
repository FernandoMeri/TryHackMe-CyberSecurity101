### üìö What I Learned / Concepts Explored

This module lays the foundation for understanding and using PowerShell, an indispensable tool in Windows environments.

#### 1. **PowerShell Basics**
   - **What is it?** It is not just a terminal; it is a **scripting language and administration shell** built on .NET. It is much more powerful than the traditional CMD.
   - **Philosophy:** It is designed for the **automation** of administrative tasks.

#### 2. **Basic Structure: Verb-Noun**
   - Commands (called **cmdlets**) follow a `Verb-Noun` convention (e.g., `Get-Process`, `Stop-Service`).
   - **Advantage:** This structure is intuitive and consistent. You know what a cmdlet does just by reading its name.
   - **Common Examples:**
     - `Get-`: Get information (Get-Service, Get-Process).
     - `Set-`: Configure or change something (Set-Service).
    - `Start-`/`Stop-`: Start or stop a service/process.
    - `Export-`/`Import-`: Export or import data.

#### 3. **Basic Cmdlets and Navigation**
   - **Navigation:** Commands similar to Linux (`Get-Location`, `Set-Location`, `Get-ChildItem`) but for Windows.
   - **File Management:** `Copy-Item`, `Remove-Item`, `Get-Content`.

#### 4. **Piping, Filtering, and Sorting Data (The Real Power)**
   - **Piping (|):** The ability to pass the output of one cmdlet as input to another. This is what allows you to create extremely powerful one-liners.
     - **Example:** `Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.CPU -gt 50} | Sort-Object CPU -Descending`
       - `Get-Process`: Gets all processes.
       - `| Where-Object {...}`: Filters and only shows processes that use more than 50% of the CPU.
       - `| Sort-Object CPU -Descending`: Sorts the result by CPU usage from highest to lowest.
   - **Filtering (`Where-Object`):** To filter results based on conditions.
   - **Sorting (`Sort-Object`):** To sort the results.

#### 5. **System, Network, and Real-Time Information**
   - **System Info:** Cmdlets such as `Get-ComputerInfo` for a complete system analysis.
   - **Network Info:** `Get-NetTCPConnection` to view active network connections (similar to `netstat`).
   - **Real-Time Analysis:** The ability to obtain system information instantly and continuously, crucial for monitoring.

#### 6. **Where to Find and Download Cmdlets**
   - **Modules:** PowerShell functionality is extended through **modules**.
   - **PowerShell Gallery:** A public repository where you can install modules with new cmdlets for specific tasks (e.g., Azure administration, AWS, security tools).
   - **Command:** `Install-Module -Name <ModuleName>`.

#### 7. **Scripting (The Next Level)**
   - **Concept:** The ability to save a series of cmdlets in a file (`.ps1`) to automate complex and repetitive tasks.
   - **Application in Cybersecurity:** Automation of data collection, log analysis, incident response, etc.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Why is it crucial in Cybersecurity?**

PowerShell is a **Swiss Army knife** for any professional:
- **Blue Team (Defense):** To monitor suspicious activity, analyze logs automatically, and deploy countermeasures.
- **Red Team (Attack):** It is a powerful offensive tool. Attackers use it to move laterally across a network, execute payloads, and evade detection, as it is a legitimate system tool.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Quickly extract and process large amounts of data from the system.

**Key Takeaway:** It's not about memorizing all the cmdlets, but about **understanding the logic and knowing how to find the solution** using `Get-Help` and `Get-Command`. This foundation will allow you to learn any specific cmdlet when you need it in the future.

## Module Completed: Networking Concepts

**Completion Date:** [2025/09/25]
**Module Objective:** Understand fundamental networking models, IP addressing, key protocols, and the encapsulation process, which are the basis for understanding how any device communicates on the Internet.

### üìö What I Learned / Key Concepts

This module explains the ‚Äúbackbone‚Äù of digital communications, a non-negotiable skill in cybersecurity.

#### 1. **Reference Models: OSI vs TCP/IP**
   - **OSI Model (7 layers):** A theoretical model that divides communication into 7 layers (Physical, Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application). It is useful for learning and diagnosing problems.
   - **TCP/IP Model (4 layers):** The practical and real model on which the Internet is based (Link, Internet, Transport, Application).
   - We learned to **compare and contrast** both models, seeing how their layers relate to each other.

#### 2. **IP Addressing and Subnets**
   - **IP Addresses:** The unique identifiers of devices on a network (e.g., `192.168.1.1` for IPv4).
   - **Subnets:** How large networks are divided into smaller parts for better organization and security.

#### 3. **Transport Protocols: TCP vs UDP**
   - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**
     - **Connection-oriented.** Establishes a channel before sending data.
     - **Reliable.** Ensures that packets arrive in order and without errors.
     - **Slower.** Used for web (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP), file transfer (FTP).
   - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**
     - **Connectionless.** Sends data without establishing a channel first.
     - **Unreliable.** Does not guarantee delivery or order.
- **Faster.** Used for video/audio streaming, VoIP, DNS.

#### 4. **Encapsulation**
   - The process of **adding information from each layer (headers)** to application data as it travels ‚Äúdown‚Äù the protocol stack to be transmitted over the network.
   - At the destination, the process is reversed (‚Äúup‚Äù), removing each header until the original data is reached.

#### 5. **Hands-on Demonstration with Telnet**
   - The **`telnet`** command was used to ‚Äútalk‚Äù directly to services (such as web servers) over TCP on a specific port.
   - This demonstrated in a tangible way how a connection is established at the application/transport level.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Why is this important?**
- **Fundamentals of Cybersecurity:** To defend, audit, or attack a network, **you must understand how it works.**
- **Traffic Analysis:** Tools such as Wireshark require this knowledge to analyze packets and detect malicious activity.
- **Troubleshooting:** It allows you to diagnose connectivity failures logically.
- **Ethical Hacking:** Understanding ports, protocols, and services is the first step in finding entry points.

> **Note:** This module lays the essential technical foundation for all subsequent rooms related to networking, pentesting, and forensics.

## Module Completed: [Networking Essentials]

**Completion Date:** [2025/09/25]
**Module Objective:** Understand the functioning and importance of fundamental protocols that enable modern networks to operate, from automatic device configuration to global routing on the Internet.

### üìö What I Learned / Protocols Explored

This module delves into the protocols that enable automatic and efficient network communication.

#### 1. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
   - **What does it do?** It automatically assigns IP addresses and other network parameters (such as the gateway and DNS server) to devices when they connect to a network.
   - **Analogy:** It is the ‚Äúautomatic rental‚Äù of IP addresses on a network.
   - **Importance in Cybersecurity:** A malicious DHCP server can trick devices into connecting to it, redirecting their traffic (‚ÄúDHCP Spoofing‚Äù attack).

#### 2. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**
   - **What does it do?** It finds the MAC (physical) address of a device when only its IP (logical) address is known within a local network.
   - **Fernando's diagram:** ‚ÄúWho has this IP? -> Tell me your MAC.‚Äù
   - **Importance in Cybersecurity:** Vulnerable to ‚ÄúARP Spoofing‚Äù or ‚ÄúARP Poisoning,‚Äù where an attacker can trick the network into sending traffic intended for someone else.

#### 3. **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**
   - **What does it do?** It is used to send control and error messages between network devices.
   - **Key Tools:**
     - **`Ping`:** Checks if a host is active and reachable on the network. (Uses ICMP Echo Request and Reply).
     - **`Traceroute`/`Tracert`:** Discovers the route that packets take to reach a destination, showing all intermediate routers.
   - **Importance in Cybersecurity:** Essential for network diagnostics. Attackers use it to ‚Äúmap‚Äù a network (discover active hosts). ICMP traffic is often blocked by firewalls to prevent this.

#### 4. **Routing Protocols**
   - **What do they do?** They are the ‚Äúnavigation systems‚Äù of routers. They allow them to share information with each other to find the best route to send packets across different networks.
   - **Main Protocols:**
     - **OSPF & EIGRP:** Used within large networks within the same organization (e.g., a company).
     - **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):** The protocol that **connects the Internet**. It manages routing *between* large service providers (ISPs). It is the most critical protocol globally.
- **RIP:** An older and simpler protocol.
- **Importance in Cybersecurity:** An attack on BGP can redirect Internet traffic on a massive scale. Understanding routing is key to defending an organization's perimeter network.

#### 5. **NAT (Network Address Translation)**
   - **What does it do?** It translates private IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.10`) from a local network to a single public IP address to access the Internet. It allows many devices to share a single public IP.
   - **Analogy:** It is the ‚Äúreceptionist‚Äù of an office. All employees (private IPs) use the same office address (public IP) to send emails outside the office.
   - **Importance in Cybersecurity:** It hides the internal structure of a network from the Internet, acting as a first layer of defense (concealment). It is essential in any home router.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Practical Conclusion**
These protocols are the ‚Äúinvisible magic‚Äù that makes networks work. A system administrator or cybersecurity professional must understand them in order to:
-   **Diagnose problems** with connectivity effectively.
-   **Understand and exploit** common vulnerabilities such as ARP Spoofing.
-   **Secure the configuration** of routers and firewalls.
