# TryHackMe - Cyber Security 101

## Module Completed: Search Skills

**Completion Date:** [2025/09/22]
**Module Objective:** Develop advanced search and information evaluation techniques for cybersecurity investigations.

### üìö What I Learned / Skills Practiced

This module focused on research methodology, teaching how to efficiently find and validate critical information.

#### 1. **Evaluating Information Sources**
   - Criteria for determining the credibility and accuracy of an online source.
   - Differentiating between reliable information and noise.

#### 2. **Efficient Use of Search Engines**
   - Advanced search techniques with Boolean operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`).
   - Use of quotation marks for exact searches and the `site:` operator to restrict searches to specific domains.

#### 3. **Specialized Search Engines**
   - **Shodan:** The ‚Äúsearch engine for Internet-connected devices.‚Äù Ideal for finding exposed systems (cameras, routers, servers).
   - **Censys:** Similar to Shodan, for discovering and analyzing hosts and infrastructures.
   - **VirusTotal:** Analyzes suspicious files, URLs, IP addresses, and domains with multiple antivirus engines.
   - **Have I Been Pwned:** Checks if your email accounts or data have been compromised in public leaks.

#### 4. **Searching for Vulnerabilities and Exploits**
   - **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):** Standard identifiers for public vulnerabilities.
   - **Exploit Database (Exploit-DB):** Archive of verified exploits and vulnerabilities.
   - **GitHub:** Key platform for finding proof-of-concept (PoC) scripts, tools, and security research.

#### 5. **Reading Technical Documentation**
   - How to navigate and understand official documentation for:
     - **Linux (`man` pages):** Manuals integrated into Unix/Linux systems.
     - **Microsoft Windows:** Docs.microsoft.com for Windows technologies.
     - **Product Documentation:** Primary sources from manufacturers for configurations and solutions.

#### 6. **Using Social Media and News Outlets**
   - How to follow security researchers and stay up to date with the latest threats on platforms such as Twitter and Reddit.
   - Identifying reliable news sources to stay informed about cyber incidents.
